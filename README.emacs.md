# Emacs setup for zeek-language-server

This file documents the configuration needed to interface emacs with
`zeek-language-server`. These instructions use `lsp-mode`. There's the
possibility it would also work with `elgot` (an `lsp-mode` replacement), but
that exercise is left to the reader. `lsp-mode` comes with an astonishing amount
of options for configuring the look and operation of the LSP features in
emacs. This guide only presents the most basic configuration. More information
about lsp-mode is available in their
[documentation](https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-mode/).

This guide assumes that you have installed `zeek-language-server` and that it is
in your `PATH`.

## Prerequisites

There are some emacs packages that are required for this to work. You can
install all of these from your favorite emacs package repository using `M-x
package-install`. The required packages are:

```fundamental
use-package
lsp-mode
lsp-ui
company-mode
yasnippet
```

It also requires the Zeek major mode from
<https://github.com/zeek/emacs-zeek-mode>. Either copy the file into a directory
in your emacs `load-path` or load the file manually like below in your `.emacs`:

```elisp
(load-file "/path/to/zeek-mode")
```

Once the above packages are installed, add the following basic configuration for
them to your `.emacs`, preferably near the top:

```elisp
(require 'package)
(add-to-list 'package-archives
         '("melpa-stable" . "https://stable.melpa.org/packages/") t)

(package-initialize)

(eval-when-compile
  (require 'use-package))

(use-package lsp-mode
         :commands lsp)
(use-package lsp-ui)
(use-package company-mode)
(use-package yasnippet)
(use-package zeek-mode)
```

## Setup

1. If needed, add the path to `zeek-config` to your environment's `PATH`
   variable.
2. Add a hook to `lsp-mode` for zeek files and register the language server.

   ```elisp
   (add-hook 'zeek-mode-hook 'lsp)
   (with-eval-after-load 'lsp-mode
     (add-to-list 'lsp-language-id-configuration
       '(zeek-mode . "zeek"))

     (lsp-register-client
       (make-lsp-client :new-connection (lsp-stdio-connection "zeek-language-server")
                        :activation-fn (lsp-activate-on "zeek")
                        :server-id 'zeek)))
   ```

3. Open a zeek script file in emacs. At this point you should notice two things
   about your emacs window. First, in the modeline it should list that it is
   using the zeek major-mode and that it connected to the LSP server. These are
   shown something like `(zeek LSP[zeek:pid])`. Second, you should have line at
   the top of the window that gives information about where in the Zeek file you
   are.
